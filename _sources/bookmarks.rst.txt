Bookmarks
============================

I created this blog mainly for myself. I want to be able to find things I want to revisit later easier. From time to time, I come across useful resources online that I know I will need again in the future (perhaps years from now). I need some place to store those links, and I want to be reminded why I added them in the first place immediately. Favorites and bookmarks in my browser aren't useful enough, because I only have titles. And sometimes the links may just no longer work for whatever reason. This page is for me to put those links and jot down some notes.

`Tmux cheatsheet <https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/>`_: It's :code:`tmux new -s mysession` and :code:`tmux attach -t mysession`. Don't use :code:`-t` for both. Unix stuff is weird. Deal with it.
