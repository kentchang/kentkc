Yesterday we visited `Mount Diablo Grand Loop Trail <https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/mount-diablo-grand-loop>`_, and this is one of the many memorable scenes that nature has to offer---a small patch of California poppies against the aftermath of wildfires. I'll let the picture speak for itself:

This is California. We make our mistakes. We fall. And we rise. [#]_ This is us.
