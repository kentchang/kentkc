Out-of-comfort-zone Reading Challenge
===================================================

I don't want to be a boring person who knows nothing outside of their specialty. I want balance in life. So I'm starting this challenge for me to read and learn something that's interesting  and reasonably complex (i.e. people might actually be learning it in college) yet slightly out of my comfort zone (nothing NLP, French Theory, and German Idealism, in other words). The deliverable will be one new blog post, where I will write about one new thing I have learned from the process. There's no time limit or a specific number of books/concepts I need to read/learn for a given period (those goals are set to be abandoned in my experience), though there will be a monthly review.

This is going to be different from my recreational reading of nonfictions (e.g. reading books on relationship or productivity). It's going to be a long-term, not quite popular kind of reading project. It's not just for fun; it's serious, but light. I'm allowing myself to consult whatever outside resources I might need. But I'm not allowing it to interfere with my academic life, so I will be spending only [5, 30] minutes chipping away the reading each day.
