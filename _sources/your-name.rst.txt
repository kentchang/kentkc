The Lyrical against the Epic: *Your Name Engraved Herein* Quick Review
======================================================================

Watching *Your Name Engraved Herein* (*Engraved* thereafter) was an interesting experience. I didn't really feel touched; it didn't wreck me the way *Girlfriend, Boyfriend* (*Gf, Bf*) did in 2012. And yet, I can't stop thinking about it. In fact, I wanted to have a new blogging platform because I felt the desperate need to say something about it. I also translated---or, attempted at a poetic interpretation of---the theme song of the film. I have been listening (and signing) it for the last 72 hours. It's incredible.

Some immediate thoughts after reading some reviews: The movie tried too hard: having watched most of the major Taiwanese gay themed movies in the past two decades, I can see the director is paying homage to all their predecessors and make their ambition obvious: it is to become part of the great gay cinematic tradition---the Great Work Begins!  And western media never seems tired of the progressivist story:[#]_ look, this was Taiwan in 1980s, and thirty years later they became the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. Look how far they've come. Das ist Aufklärung! I didn't really feel any of that. I was in high school in Taiwan from 2008--2011, and the experience felt remarkably similar. Taipei may not be too different from San Fransisco, but Taipei is one small part of the island, and the generation gap---plus the conflicts that may ensue---still exists: one may be accepted by their peers, but not necessarily by their parents, and that's the problem.

If anything, the movie counters this progressivist narrative: nothing really changed. While we may have elected a female president, who defeated the Nationalist/KMT tradition that the movie ridicules, its presence remains strong in contemporary Taiwanese society, and our democracy remains young and feeble. This is not exactly a new theme; *Gf, Bf*, for one, is resolutely a masculinist inquiry, and the characters are deprived of their agency to reject the (Foucauldian) power writ large. Liam (together with Mabel and Aaron) is the unforutnate victim of the repressive hypothesis. But that does not apply to A-Han and Birdy; they manage to stage multiple wanderings/diasporas (to Pingtung, of all places, and eventually Quebec). To come out of the closet, it seems, one has to come out of everything else first. A-Han is an admirable character because he's the one that somehow moves past and beyond the phyiscal and psychological barriers in search for his personal, spiritual just as sexual, liberation. Liam never really does in *Gf, Bf*.

The Great Gay Tradition has largely about redemption; the most appealing aspect about *Engraved* is how it is ultimately about the recovery of autonomy to seek personal reparation. The most moving scene for me is when A-Han's passionate dialectics of love culminates in him demanding Father Oliver, "Help me to go to hell." Obviously, he is neither Aeneas nor Paul; he has access to neither. He can't be an epic hero. What turns out to be pleasantly surprising is that his presumptive guide is just as troubled---of course, the dramatic irony comes only belatedly. Along with the less pleasant scene in Feb 28 Memorial Park, *Engraved* artistically destructs all the patriarchal symbols out there. Only when they are out of our way can we seek to develop a new aesthetic paradigm. It may be late for Jia-han and Birdy---but there's hope.

Poetic interpretation

If you don't remember the song, I would recommend that you review and check out `this cover <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hxO8-YdB6s>`_.

I can't call this translation because I paid zero attention to, alas, fidelity and equivalence. My goal is to recreate the aesthetic experience through another language (English). Many phrases are hard to translate, or basically untranslatable (they evoke feelings, not make sense), but I think I did a satisfactory job here. I believe Netflix has a more literal translation, if that's what you're looking for.

*Oublie-le*— |br|
For so many times I’ve told myself: |br|
The harder you chase the shadow of the light, |br|
The farther you are from it. That’s it. |br|

*"Je t'aimais"*— |br|
Engraved only on my heart. |br|
On the other end of my difficult confessions |br|
Is your generous silence. |br|

On the bottom of my heart— |br|
Your name engraved herein— |br|
Where time has lost its essence. |br|
And so my only lie lingers |br|
All of my life. Once, |br|
Only a deadlock existed |br|
Between the world and I, so tenacious. |br|
Mere breathing felt luxurious. |br|

:oneindent:`If there’s a next time,` |br|
:oneindent:`I will fall in love again.` |br|

On the bottom of my heart— |br|
Your name engraved herein, |br|
Buried and sealed—or how do I live |br|
The rest of my life? |br|
I am surrounded by neon lights. |br|
In my hand is the address |br|
That would bring me up to paradise. |br| 
You soar high, |br|
And here I stay, stagnant. |br|

Looking for you— |br|
Lost in the crowd, but thought of you  |br|
Again, struggled to leave |br|
The thoughts behind, but memories— |br|
They brought me back, back into the past. |br|

On the bottom of my heart— |br|
Your name engraved herein— |br|
Where time has lost its essence. |br|
I’d let myself fall in love once |br|
And forever, just once. |br|
I wish the world would stay like this |br|
So memories wouldn’t feel luxurious. |br|

:oneindent:`If there’s a next time,` |br|
:oneindent:`I will fall in love again.` |br|

On the bottom of my heart— |br|
Your name engraved herein, |br|
Buried and sealed—or how do I live |br|
The rest of my life? |br|
I reside in my remembrance |br|
Of you, with the key to the heavens |br|
In my hand. You shall soar, |br|
And I’ll be here, tenacious as ever. |br|

On the bottom of my heart— |br|
Your name engraved herein— |br|
Where time has lost its essence. |br|
I’d let myself fall in love once  |br|
And forever, just once. |br|
I wish the world would stay like this |br|
So memories wouldn’t feel luxurious. |br|

:oneindent:`If there’s a next time,` |br|
:oneindent:`I will fall in love again.` |br|
